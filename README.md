# sysadmin-reading-list
A reading list for the larval stage sysadmin. This list is focused on the UNIX family of OSes.

So you've got your first sysadmin job. Congratulations, it's going to be an interesting ride.

## Languages

### Bash

Every sysadmin needs to know Bash.

### Ruby

If you're in a Ruby shop, you'll want these:

* [Ruby Best Practices](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596523015.do)


## Tools

### Regular Expressions

You're going to want your regular expressions to be like:

![xkcd 208](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/regular_expressions.png),

but in reality they're going to be a lot more like at first:

![xkcd 1171](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/perl_problems.png) some days.

But seriously, you're going to find regexes very useful for handling logs.

* [Regular Expressions Cookbook](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023630.do)
* [Introducing Regular Expressions](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920012337.do)

### Sed & Awk

* [sed and awk Pocket Reference](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596003524.do) presents a concise summary of regular expressions and pattern matching, and summaries of sed and awk and how to use them to edit files and convert data from one format to another.

### Source control

#### Git

Whether or not your shop uses git internally, you're going to end up needing to use it for the many useful things on GitHub.

* [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is a great resource.

### SSH

* [SSH, The Secure Shell: The Definitive Guide, 2nd Edition](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596008956.do)

### Text Editors:

Don't get involved in the Editor Wars.  Just.  Don't.  Your choice of tool does not need defending.  Nor does anyone else's choice.

However, you should care about your tools.  You should be able to use them efficiently.

#### Vim

Vim is a reality of life for SysAdmins.  You must be able to do at least basic edits with it.  You don't need to love it, but you will have to use it.

* [vi and Vim Editors Pocket Reference, 2nd Edition](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920010913.do)

* [Damian Conway, "More Instantly Better Vim" - OSCON 2013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHm36-na4-4)

#### Emacs

Many people like Emacs.  You might be one of them.  Don't be afraid to try it out.

#### Visual Editors and IDEs

Use tools with which you are productive.  If you want to use a GUI Text Editor or IDE, don't let anyone give you a hard time about that.

There are GUI versions of vim and emacs that have ardent followers.

[Atom](https://atom.io/) is a fairly new editor with significant traction and plugin ecosystem.

## Blogs and Podcasts

* [Arrested Devops](https://www.arresteddevops.com/) is hosted by Matt Stratton, Trevor Hess, and Bridget Kromhout. ADO is the podcast that helps you achieve understanding, develop good practices, and operate your team and organization for maximum DevOps awesomeness.
