  * Keep descriptions short (<80 characters).
  * End descriptions with a period.
* Make an individual commit for each category.
  * Order projects alphabetically.
* Put only stuff on the list you can personally recommend.
* Use imperative (e.g. add instead of added/adding) in your commit descriptions.
